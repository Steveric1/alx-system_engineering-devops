Task 0:

What is a server?:
   A server is a computer or software system that provides services, resources, or functionalities to other computers, known as clients within a network. Servers are designed to handle specific tasks and facilitate communication and resource-sharing in a networked environment. They are vital in various IT scenarios, including web hosting, data storage, email management, and more.

What is the role of the domain name?:
   The role of the domain name is to provide a human-readable way to Identify and locate resources, such as websites on the internet. It translates the server's numerical IP address to a human-readable name, making it easier for users to access websites without having to memorize the numerical IP address.

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com 
    The type of DNS record is A record.
An A record specifically associates an IPv4 address with a domain or subdomain.

What is the role of the web server?:
  The role of the web server is to serve static content to the user, static content like HTML, CSS, Javascript, video, audio, or images to the user. Sending a redirect, or delegating the dynamic response generation to some other program such as CGI script, JavaServer Pages (JSPs), Active Server Pages (ASP), server-side Javascript, or some other server-side technologies. 

What is the role of the application server?:
  The application server executes the application code and processes the dynamic content. It interfaces between the web server and source code, handling tasks like business logic, data processing, and interaction with the databases.

What is the role of the database?:
  The role of the database is to store and manage data needed by the application. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update information from the database.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?:
  The server is using the DNS server to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the websites.

Issues with this infrastructure Design

Lack Of Redundancy:
A single Point Of Failure is bound to happen with this design because of a lack of redundancy and having a single server to handle incoming traffic can result in a failure scenario, especially during periods of high traffic.
Monitoring:
A single point of failure will occur in this design because of the absence of monitoring tools that will monitor the software to check for bugs or errors in the software that can cause the software to fail or load.
Deploying and Server Restart:
When deploying new code or performing maintenance tasks, the web server needs to be restarted. During this restart, the web server is temporarily unavailable causing downtime for the user trying to access the website.
This downtime can impact user experience and disrupt service availability.
